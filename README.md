- 👋 Hello everyone, my name is Blake AKA @robolor
- 👀 I am currently working in a technical support role and constantly building upon my software and web development skills in my free time.
- 🌱 I’m always looking for new knowledge to absorb, but my interest in software development started with a college course on c++, back in 2016, which has lead me to where I am today. Since then I have taken multiple Udemy courses on languages such as python, HTML, and css. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaberate on projects that push my comfort zone and build my repertoire until I am ready to start my first software development position.
- 📫 You can reach me for business inquiries at: robolor.official@gmail.com
